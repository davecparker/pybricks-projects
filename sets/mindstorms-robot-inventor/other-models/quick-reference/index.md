## Description

You can use the code for this project as a quick reference to the various functions
available for the hub, motors, and sensors that come in the 51515 kit. The program
includes most (but not all) of the functions available for these devices.

You can actually run the entire program on an Inventor hub with 3 motors on ports 
A, B, and E, color sensor on C, and distance sensor on D, but the real purpose is 
to show function syntax examples in the code. 

## Program

{% include copy-code.html %}
```python
{% include_relative Quick_Ref.py %}
```
